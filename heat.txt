* Create a constructor that accepts three arguments: 
the diffusion coefficient alpha (of type T), 
the number of points per dimension m (of type int) and 
the time-step size dt (of type T). 
The constructor must create the iteration matrix M 
given in the introduction and store the result as an attribute with type Matrix<T>.

* Create a method Vector<T> exact(T t) const 
that returns the exact solution at time t evaluated 
at all interior grid points (see introduction).

* Create a method Vector<T> solve(T t) const 
that solves the initial boundary value problem 
given in the introduction using the procedure 
given at the end of the introduction until time t and 
returns the numerical solution at the last time step.
