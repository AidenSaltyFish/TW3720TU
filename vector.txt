whereby the Vector’s elements are of type T. The Vector class must provide the following functionality:

Constructors and destructor

1. A default constructor that sets the length to zero.
2. A copy constructor and a move constructor that creates a Vector from another Vector.
3. A constructor that takes a length as an argument and allocates the internal data structures accordingly.
4. A constructor that takes an initialiser list representing the contents of this Vector, allocates the internal 
data structures and initialises the Vector’s content accordingly.
5. A destructor.

Operators and functions

1. A copy assignment operator and a move assignment operator from another Vector.
2. An operator[](int i) that returns a reference to the i-th entry of the vector. Implement an overload of this operator that returns a constant reference. 
Both operators can be used to access the entries in functions that are implemented outside the Vector class.
3. Arithmetic operators operator+ and operator- to add and subtract two Vectors. These operators must support Vectors of different types, 
whereby the resulting Vector has to be of the type that dominates (e.g., double dominates float). If the Vectors have different lengths, 
all operators must throw an exception.
4. Arithmetic operators operator* between a scalar and a Vector (w=s⋅v) and a Vector and a scalar (w=v⋅s), 
whereby the scalar and the Vector can have different types and the resulting Vector must be of the dominating type.
5. A function len that returns the length of the Vector. This function can be used to retrieve the length in functions that are implemented outside the Vector class.
